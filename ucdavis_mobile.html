As a part of the design team at #include, I worked to refresh this research lab website to improve the user experience and overall look, allow key audiences better navigate this site, and convey the lab’s mission in a clear and engaging way.

                        <p>In order to properly align our goals with the stakeholder’s goals, we conducted a stakeholder interview with Jorge Pena, lab director of VICTR lab. From this, we gathered information about the project timeline + limitations, design constraints, potential users + audiences to target, high traffic pages, and stakeholder goals for the website redesign.

                        In terms of website analytics, we found that high traffic pages included <b>News Items, Prospective Students, and Become an Undergraduate Student</b>.

                        <p>During user testing, we found that the organization in the navbar was confusing and unintuitive, so we set on fixing this issue. Below is the current and revised sitemap for comparison. Here are some revisions made: 
                        <br><br>
                        <u>Research / Background</u><br>Place in “About”, instead of on the sidebar. This way, there is more open space on each page for other text, and all lab information is now in “About”. 
                        <br><br>
                        <u>Become an Undergraduate Student</u><br>During user testing, we found that this was one of the most confusing pages to locate—it currently is placed on the sidebar, but is only accessible after scrolling. In addition, by just looking at the tabs, it’s unclear to users that prospective undergraduates (not only prospective graduates) can join. Thus, both (prospective undergraduates and prospective graduates) are now under “Get Involved”. 
                        <br><br>
                        <u>Prospective Graduate Students</u><br>Site is only inviting to prospective graduate students, not undergraduates. In addition, using a title such as “Get Involved” introduces an encouraging and inviting CTA for students looking to join. 
                        <br><br>
                        <u>Graduate Students</u></u><br>“Prospective Graduate Students” and “Graduate Students” sounds too closely related—titles were confusing during user testing and do not elaborate on the differences. Tab is now put under “Team”, where all lab members are introduced.
