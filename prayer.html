                    <p>Although this may not be the most conventional of pages, or the most conventional way to ask for prayer requests, it doesn’t hurt to do so! I want to be able to encourage and care for anyone who comes across this website—whether I know you personally, whether you’re a stranger on the other side of the world, whether I’ve only just met you once—we all have something to possibly pray for. I’d love to support you through prayer to God in this way, and keep you in my thoughts as I go throughout the week!</p>
