	Hello! 

	I'm Cynthia, a third-year Cognitive Science major at UC Davis. 
	I'm interested in UI/UX and human-centered design--let's talk about it! 

	Feel free to explore this site; I've got work / projects and some info about me. 
	Contact me @ cluchen@ucdavis.edu and I'll get back to you as soon as possible :)
