hello! 
have some fun looking around at my code; no website-creation sites such as squarespace or wix was utilized, as i was lucky enough to have the time + energy this summer to work on building from scratch! please don't copy + paste any lines of code / plagiarize - it'll be a learning experience for you to code and design yourself, just as it was for me.

                        <p>In order to properly align our goals with the stakeholder’s goals, we conducted a stakeholder interview with Jorge Pena, lab director of VICTR lab. From this, we gathered information about the project timeline + limitations, design constraints, potential users + audiences to target, high traffic pages, and stakeholder goals for the website redesign. 
                        <br><br>
                        In terms of website analytics, we found that high traffic pages included <b>News Items, Prospective Students, and Become an Undergraduate Student</b>. This data helped shape an indication of user types who were visiting the page, as well as what their goals and purposes were.

                        <p>As a full group, we took a cursory look by spending a few minutes analyzing the site individually, taking note of what could be improved. In addition, it allowed designers, developers, and PMs gain familiarity with the site. Some things noticed included:

                        A year ago, Minhee and I had taken DES 1 (Introduction to Design) and for our final project, had been on a team together (with Thorie Asgeirsdottir and Christina Aliev) that focused tackling sustainable solutions to water consumption in produce. This DES 1 project took around 1 month, and involved extensive user research and presentations as well as prototypes of a physical barcode design. At HackDavis, we decided to further expand on this project as a team of four and worked on developing a digital app that was simple and accessible. <b>Thus, this case study combines both user research done in DES 1 as well prototypes + development created during HackDavis!</b>

                        <p>To more deeply understand and locate user’s goals and site pain points, we tested and interviewed two Linguistic / Communications Undergraduate students and an Education Graduate Student.
                        <br><br>
                        After asking introductory and industry/website-specific questions, we took interviewees on a walkthrough of the site to observe how they used the site and accessed information. Furthermore, we asked sample user goals to see how they navigated the site to achieve these goals.  Below is a sample of a user goal we asked an interviewee—“You’re an undergraduate at UC Davis interested in this lab. Search up how to join the lab as an Undergraduate Research Assistant”—as well as his user flow to navigate to “Become an Undergraduate Research Assistant”. 
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, through the usability tests, we found that the navbar and side-navigation was not intuitive to users. For example, users, given the goal of finding information on how to join the lab as an Undergraduate, quickly looked to “Prospective Graduate Students” as well as “Graduate Students” before looking at the sidebar. After these tests, we asked interviewees follow up questions about their experience and what they wanted changed.

                        <p>During user testing, we found that the organization in the navbar was confusing and unintuitive, so we set on fixing this issue. Below is the current and revised sitemap for comparison. Here are some revisions made: 
                        <br><br>
                        <u>Research / Background</u><br>Place in “About”, instead of on the sidebar. This way, there is more open space on each page for other text, and all lab information is now in “About”. 
                        <br><br>
                        <u>Become an Undergraduate Student</u><br>During user testing, we found that this was one of the most confusing pages to locate—it currently is placed on the sidebar, but is only accessible after scrolling. In addition, by just looking at the tabs, it’s unclear to users that prospective undergraduates (not only prospective graduates) can join. Thus, both (prospective undergraduates and prospective graduates) are now under “Get Involved”. 
                        <br><br>
                        <u>Prospective Graduate Students</u><br>Site is only inviting to prospective graduate students, not undergraduates. In addition, using a title such as “Get Involved” introduces an encouraging and inviting CTA for students looking to join. 
                        <br><br>
                        <u>Graduate Students</u></u><br>“Prospective Graduate Students” and “Graduate Students” sounds too closely related—titles were confusing during user testing and do not elaborate on the differences. Tab is now put under “Team”, where all lab members are introduced.
