            <h2>Clipper Card</h2><br>
            <p>Because I travel around the Bay Area alot throughout the year, I'm always using Bart and my Clipper Card in order to get where I need to be! Whether that be going in to SF to work, or traveling to Fremont or going back home, I always need to have it with me and with easy access so that I don't need to fumble in my backpack looking for my card.</p>

        <section id="phone_click">
            <h2>Phone</h2><br>
            <p>My phone is the hub for me in which I can contact others and get information about the world! I also have a few social media apps, and it helps me get up to date about what's happening. It's also a gateway to learning for me - whether that be YouTube, Medium, or more, everything I need to know about a topic is just a google away.</p>

        <section id="notebook_click">
            <h2>Notebook</h2><br>
            <p>It's nice being able to write down things on actual paper instead of typing everything up, so having my notebook in my backpack is a nice safety measure for me throughout the day. It's also a quick way for me to draw up sudden ideas I have, if I have any!</p>
