                    <p style = "color: #A0A0A0; font-size: 16px;">The influx of tech has resulted in a major housing crisis, a loss of novelty, and an exodus of residents. How has this slowly come to be over time?<br><br>
                    
                    How are 1960s Silicon Valley different from 2020s Silicon Valley? Similar? <br><br>
                    
                    Have the changing dynamics of Silicon Valley affected you in your own life?  </p>

                    <p>Silicon Valley has undergone numerous changes within the past 30 years as a result of the “tech boom” that’s exploded not only digitially, but also in the San Francisco Bay Area. <br><br>
                    
                    Compared to 30 years ago, the income gap has widened—the rich are getting richer due to generous salaries in tech; the poor are getting poorer as jobs are now being outsourced, contracted, automated; native residents are leaving due to rising costs, and the region’s middle class is smaller with the average household income increasing. <br><br>
                    
                    The past few decades of growing culture has facilitated not only an digital divide, but also, a growing income / societal divide.</p>
