                    <p style = "color: #969696; font-size: 15px;">The influx of tech has resulted in a major housing crisis, a loss of novelty, and an exodus of residents due to rising prices. How has this slowly come to be over time?<br><br>
                    
                    How is 1960s Silicon Valley different from 2020s Silicon Valley? How are they similar? <br><br>
                    
                    What brought about this influx of tech? </p>

                    <h3>Silicon Valley has undergone numerous changes within the past 30 years as a result of the “tech boom” that’s exploded not only online but also in the San Francisco Bay Area. <br><br>
                    
                    Compared to 30 years ago, the income gap has widened—the rich are getting richer due to generous salaries in tech; the poor are getting poorer as jobs are now being outsourced, contracted, automated; the region’s middle class is smaller and the average household income is increasing. <br><br>
                    
                    The past few decades of growing culture has facilitated not only an digital divide, but also, a growing income / societal divide.</h3>
