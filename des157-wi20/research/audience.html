                <p>John is the first persona. He's a 22 year old male who's relocated to the Bay Area / Silicon Valley, and he's working in tech as at a high-level company. He's interested in learning about the tech world, as well as this new area he's living in. Thus, he seeks to have a digital interactive news-like site to learn more about the space he's in, and how tech has impacted the rise of it all.

                <a href="#"><p style = "font-size: 16px;"></p>Albert, 56</p></a>
                <p>Albert has lived in the Bay Area all his life, has been born and raised here, and continues to work and raise a household in Palo Alto. Because tech hasn't prelevant 50 so years ago, he's seen the changes in the dynamic of the space he's grown up in. He seeks to document how this change has occured, as well as keep note of the childhood Palo Alto he called home.</p>
