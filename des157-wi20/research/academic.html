                <h3 style = "text-align: center; font-weight: 400;">Modern-Day Inequality in Silicon Valley</h3>
                <br>
                <p style = "text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silicon Valley has undergone numerous changes within the past 10-20 years as a result of the “tech boom” that’s exploded not only online but also in the San Francisco Bay Area. Compared to 30 years ago, the income gap has widened—the rich are getting richer due to generous salaries in tech; the poor are getting poorer as jobs are now being outsourced, contracted, or automated; the region’s middle class is smaller and the average household income is increasing. The past few decades of growing digital culture has facilitated not only an online digital divide, but also, a growing income and societal divide. 
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we can examine the statistical backing for how the Silicon Valley region has changed due to the influx of tech and big name firms. According to the Cal Budget Center, in recent years, “the income gaps between Silicon Valley’s top 1% of households and the bottom 99% are among the widest in California and significantly wider than they were a generation before...the middle class has shrunk, while the number of households that have, over the same period, risen up or fallen down the economic ladder have increased”. Furthermore, the annual earnings of workers in Silicon Valley now come to a medium of $140,000, more than double the national average. As a result, poverty is now being more and more defined within the San Francisco Bay Area—by these numbers, the lowering poverty rates seem to be good, but in reality, it’s due to the unsettling reality that lower-income families are being forced to move out of the Bay Area. The nationwide poverty rate is around 16.4%, yet the average for Silicon Valley is lower: 12% for San Francisco county, 8.4% for Santa Clara county, and 7.3% for San Mateo county. However, many of these low-income, poverty-stricken residents live in areas of highly concentrated poverty like the notorious East Palo Alto—which ironically neighbors Facebook’s Menlo Park HQ within a 15 minute drive—as well as places like SF’s Tenderloin, Bayview-Hunters Point, and more.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s easy to imagine a troubling region where home prices are beginning to skyrocket, new startups are popping in and out while being acquired by tech giants every couple of days, and non-tech residents are leaving while the best and brightest middle-to-high class tech graduates are pouring in. So why is this? What specific to the influx of tech has brought this about? Los Angeles has the highest concentration of entertainment jobs, yet there’s no intense disparaging income gap—why is it, that for the San Francisco Bay Area, this similarly high concentration of tech has brought about such obstructive societal results?
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big reason can be linked to “firm inequality”—tech giants fight in a winner-take-all format, where companies such as LinkedIn, Dropbox, Google, and Facebook fight head to head for the best coders, project managers, designers, and more. As a result, each company devotes themselves to generous benefits, enticing talented job seekers to fall in love with whatever company offers the best hourly salary, sign-on bonus, gym / spa / pets / family monthly benefits, free food, friendly and quirky work environment, etc. As these giants give out salaries hoping to beat the likes of other giants, this drives the average annual earnings to be absorbently high. For example, for even interns (college-level summer interns!) the average SWE (Software Engineering) intern pays around $35/hour. Salesforce, Twillo, and Uber pays around $50/hour, Lyft pays interns up to $60/hour, and among the tech giants, Facebook notoriously pays the most generously at around $65/hour (Reddit Intern Salary Sharing). That’s well above an annual income of $100,000—and these are college students, still in the middle of their Database, Algorithm Design, and Data Structures courses—making more than an average American graduate today.  
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As these companies seek to attract the best and brightest tech graduates, low-level jobs at these same companies—such as janitors, line managers, manufacturing / factory workers, administrative staff, and company shuttle drivers—don’t enjoy the same benefits due to being a “contractor”, not an employee. Furthermore, these jobs are now being outsourced or automated within the past couple of years, while the overall employee head count stays the same. While monetary resources are being saved due to cutting down benefits for low-level jobs, companies are able to redirect these funds to instead hire upper-level positions or raise annual salaries for these employees. For example, Google falls into this criteria. While its software engineers and data scientists freely enjoy annual salaries of $250K+ and perks such as free transportation, free food, and generous health insurance, Google’s own company shuttle drivers don’t see the same benefits as they are “contractors” (Nicholas Boom 10).  
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's easy to read all of this and go on a passionate spree against big tech, but it's brought a prosperous economy, exciting innovation, and brought our society to achieve things we've never even dreamed of before. However, it's not all perfect, and this tech influx also leads us to the second paragraph above, where  “the income gaps between Silicon Valley’s top 1% of households and the bottom 99% are among the widest in California and significantly wider than they were a generation before”. Although things may not change anytime soon, an awareness of this fact can dramatically lessen the societal gap, facilitate empathy and encouragement for both sides of the wealth disparity, and possibly enact change for supporting  low-income jobs in Silicon Valley.
