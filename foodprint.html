We inform customers of how much hidden water is in what they buy, which in turn encourages them to compare across brands and choose a water-wiser option. By simply presenting facts to our audience, we can tackle the issue of water over-consumption through the small step of awareness!</p>

                        <p>Our team decided to go on the sustainability track, as with water the most important resource on earth, we wanted to tackle the issue of water. We found that for first-world countries, the problem lies primarily water filtration, water conservation, and our water-related environmental footprint.<br><br>
                        Specifically narrowing down into each, water conservation proved striking; the main issue with water conservation lies in the fact that the public isn’t well educated in where, and when, they are wasting water. With UC Davis as a notable agricultural school, we decided to focus on water conservation through an agricultural aspect.

                        <p>We often associate water conservation with cutting back on showers, gardening, and other examples, but it’s important to not that the food we eat also uses gallons of water to grow. Here, California grows “nearly half of all US fruits, veggies, and nuts”, that we are “on track to experience the driest year in the past half millennium” (motherjones). Fruits, nuts, and vegetables such as broccoli, almonds, and lettuce are accountable for the loss in water—so much so, that farms use about 80% of the state’s developed water (water from its natural source).<br><br><br>
