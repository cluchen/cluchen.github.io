                        <p>This app was built during HackDavis 2019, and thus, we had 24 hours to come up with an idea, iterate, develop, and present. Within the different tracks presented at the hackathon, we chose to tackle sustainability—a topic that we found to be both important and having vast opportunities and implications with tech.<br><br>
                        A year ago, Minhee and I had taken DES 1 (Introduction to Design) and for our final project, had been on a team together (with Thorie Asgeirsdottir and Christina Aliev) that focused tackling sustainable solutions to water consumption in produce. This DES 1 project took around 1 month, and involved extensive user research and presentations as well as prototypes of a physical barcode design. At HackDavis, we decided to further expand on this project as a team of four and worked on developing a digital app that was simple and accessible. <b>Thus, this case study combines both user research done in DES 1 as well prototypes + development created during HackDavis!</b>

                        <p><b>From this, one thing we learned was that while we often associate water conservation with cutting back on showers, gardening, and other examples,  it’s important to note that the food we eat also uses gallons of water to grow.</b> Here, California grows “nearly half of all US fruits, veggies, and nuts” that we are “on track to experience the driest year in the past half millennium” (motherjones). Fruits, nuts, meat, and vegetables such as broccoli, almonds, beef, and lettuce are accountable for the loss in water—so much so, that farms use about 80% of the state’s developed water (water from its natural source).</p>
                        <p><b>The public is largely uneducated about this fact, and it’s also difficult to know how much water is used in the produce you’re buying. To look up each item one-by-one is also extremely exhausting, which contributes to this lack in education.</b><br><br>

                            1) Scan the barcode <br>
                            2) Display how much water it took <br>

                        <p>Because HackDavis was 24 hours, we had limitations in this project, such as:</p>
                        <ul style = "padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">
                            <li>Not enough time + energy! There was much more we could have further implemented, such as utilizing Google’s Cloud Vision API to detect images of the produce itself (instead of a barcode). This would eliminate the need to add physical barcodes to price tags in every grocery store, overall improving efficiency.</li>
                            <li>None of us had touched Swift prior to HackDavis 2019, and the first few hours of HackDavis entailed Celina and I designing initial prototypes, while June and Minhee quickly picked up as much Swift as they could. It was chaotic! But a great learning experience overall.</li>
                            <li>We weren’t able to conduct user testing on prototypes due to lack of time—all iterations were done with decisions by Celina and I. If we were to further work on this project, we would greatly benefit from testing!</li>
                        </ul>   
                        <p>Nevertheless, for all four of us, HackDavis was our first hackathon, yet we spent the entire time devoting ourselves to prototyping, wireframing, designing, and pushing code (all while on less than 4 hours of sleep + with lots of yerba mate!). All of us felt that creative excitement and were so eager to build even in our insecurity and lack of experience...and I'm glad we pushed through and learned so much along the way.
