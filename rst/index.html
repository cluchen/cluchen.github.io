                                In the Epic of Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh goes and seeks out Sinduri - a wise figure - for advice and wisdom on his fate. She tells Gilgamesh that only the gods live forever, and offers advice to embrace mortality in men and instead, enjoy himself in the days of his life. We can see the lines of text below:

                                In the book of Ecclesiastes, the Preacher (narrator) instructs the reader to realize true wisdom - 
                                that many things in life are fleeting, a vapor in the wind - and instead, enjoy their days in life 
                                and embrace mortality (similar to what is repeated in Gilgamesh). We can see the lines of text below:

Thus, because we all succumb to death, what’s left of humans is to enjoy their toil while they are alive. <br><br>Secondly, we see “futility” (hevel, or fleeting like vapor): the inability of humans to make sense of the world around them. Humans tend to try to make a plan for lives, seek after rewards, and invest in pursuits. But the mindset of the good being rewarded and the wicked being punished doesn’t seem to work in this life, based on the wisdom of the preacher.

For example, after Enkidu’s death, Gilgamesh comes to terms with the idea of death, and thus searches for immortality in the denial of death. <br><br>
                                But at the end of this journey, Utanapishitm teaches him that immortality is futile and death is inescapable through a simple test: whether he can go days without sleep. Gilgamesh fails, and finally realizes his mortality and accepts death.
