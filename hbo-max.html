                                <p>I took a part-time leave from school Fall Quarter to go intern at HBO Max on the UXR team! Was exciting to work on a product that was in the beginning stages of being built and growing, as there was an overwhelming avenues of research dive into. Over the course of 7 weeks, I worked to support other researchers and led my own research study uncovering content recommendations. This project is largely under NDA, so please contact me for more information!<br><br><br>

I'm unable to disclose much of this project, so stay tuned for updates to this page on the process and results. On a high level, I worked with Designers and PMs to undercover this underlying question: <br><br>

                                <p>I largely led this research on my own, with meetings and check-ins weekly with Susan (my manager) and the rest of the team. I felt that it was valuable to me to start tackling research as if I was a full-time researcher now that I was interning as a UX Researcher the second time around. <br>

                                    <li>Working on a consumer-facing product made the research I was doing incredibly understandable, as I could see and understand from a user perspective (I had, myself, been subscribed to HBO Max). This made much of the initial stages of research much, much easier for me to tackle. </li>
                                    <li>This was a small team, which meant that I had the opportunity to be fairly autonomous with my work. And with autonomy meant that I had to be disciplined and strict in keeping myself accountable in getting work done, by making checklists and taking notes to make sure I was still being productive every day. </li>
                                    <li>I really got to learn to be comfortable in user interviews — establishing rapport with participants, making sure they felt heard, not being hard pressed to follow the script, etc. While before this internship, sometimes I was still with some nerves in interview sessions, I felt myself loosen up with more practice.
